# Unity Shader Formatter
Unity Shader Formatter is a simple tool designed to format Unity's ShaderLab and compute shader code. This project was developed because I couldn't find any functional formatters for Unity compute shaders.

The development of this project is with the help of Cursor AI, and I am not familiar with APIs related to the VSCode extension system. So there might be bugs, and please help report issues or contribute to this project.
